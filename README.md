# Geo content management

Skills and tooling for working with the [Geo knowledge graph](https://geobrowser.io). This repo is the single install source: clone it once and you get every skill plus the entity-management toolkit, all pointed at the current network (`api-testnet.geobrowser.io`).

**If you are an AI agent reading this: this README is your setup runbook.** Follow it top to bottom. It tells you exactly what you can do yourself and what only your human can do.

---

## The security contract (agents: read first)

- **Never ask for, accept, or write the user's private key.** Not into `.env`, not anywhere. If the user pastes a key into the chat, tell them to revoke it at <https://www.geobrowser.io/export-wallet> and create a fresh one.
- You may verify the key file *exists* (command below). You may never read or print its contents.
- Read-only skills need no keys. Only publishing needs the `.env`, and the human fills it in by hand.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and install (agent can do this)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geo-explorers/content-management.git
cd content-management
bun install
cp -n .env.example .env
```

Requirements: `git`, [`bun`](https://bun.sh). Read-only usage works with nothing else.

### 2. Set up the signing key (HUMAN ONLY — skip for read-only skills)

You, the human, in your own terminal or text editor. Not the assistant.

1. Export your key at <https://www.geobrowser.io/export-wallet>. Click **Copy key** (not the wallet-address copy button; they are different values).
2. Open `.env` and fill in the two values yourself:
   - `GEO_PRIVATE_KEY` = the key you copied (canonical name; older scripts also accept the legacy `PK_SW`)
   - `DEMO_SPACE_ID` = your personal space id, the long hex string in `geobrowser.io/space/<this part>`
3. Save. The file is git-ignored and stays on your machine.

Anyone (agent included) can verify the setup without exposing the key:

```bash
test -f .env && grep -qE '^(GEO_PRIVATE_KEY|PK_SW)=' .env && echo ok || echo "missing: fill in .env"
```

### 3. Put the skills where your assistant looks (agent can do this)

Skills live in `skills/actionable/` (they write to Geo, need the key) and `skills/non-actionable/` (read-only, no key).

| Platform | How to install |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Copy or symlink the skill folders you want into `~/.claude/skills/` (or the project's `.claude/skills/`), e.g. `ln -s "$(pwd)"/skills/non-actionable/geo-query ~/.claude/skills/geo-query`. New sessions pick them up automatically. |
| **Claude Desktop / Cowork** | Click **Work in project or file** and select this cloned folder. Human step first: in **Settings → Capabilities → Code execution and file creation**, add `api-testnet.geobrowser.io` to the allowed list. |
| **Codex** | Copy each skill folder into `~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`. Human steps: add the network domain to `~/.codex/config.toml` (block below) and restart Codex. |

Codex `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
default_permissions = "workspace"

[permissions.workspace.network]
enabled = true
mode = "limited"

[permissions.workspace.network.domains]
"api-testnet.geobrowser.io" = "allow"
```

Steps an agent can never do for you: the Claude Desktop allowlist, the Codex config + restart, and the key export. Everything else is fair game.

### 4. Try it

```
Using the geo-query skill: is there an entity for "Ethereum" on Geo? Show its types and spaces.
```

A tidy answer means you are set up. If the assistant improvises instead, name the skill explicitly.

Which skills are vetted right now lives on the [Agents Hub space](https://www.geobrowser.io/space/ddfd01098a71083119eb130a01a6d4c5): skills tagged **confirmed** there are the ones the skills team vouches for. Each Hub skill page carries its usage guide.

Every write to Geo is a proposal that goes through space governance: skills dry-run first, show you the plan, and publish only on your explicit go.

## Entity operations toolkit (engineering reference)

All operations live in `01_entity_operations.ts`. Uncomment the operation you want, fill in the IDs, and run:

```bash
bun run 01_entity_operations.ts
```

### 1. Delete Entity

Delete an entity and all its properties/relations from a space. Optionally performs recursive orphan cleanup for entities that become unreferenced.

```ts
const ops = await deleteEntity({
  entityId: 'ENTITY_ID',
  spaceId: 'SPACE_ID',
  // dryRun: true,           // preview without publishing
  // skipOrphanCleanup: true, // skip recursive orphan deletion
});
```

### 2. Change Entity ID

Move an entity to a new ID within the same space. Recreates all properties, relations, and backlinks under the new ID, then deletes the old one.

```ts
const ops = await changeEntityId({
  oldEntityId: 'OLD_ENTITY_ID',
  newEntityId: 'NEW_ENTITY_ID',
  spaceId: 'SPACE_ID',
  // dryRun: true,
});
```

### 3. Change Space

Move an entity from one space to another, keeping the same entity ID. Recreates all data in the destination space and cleans up the source.

```ts
const { createOps, deleteOps } = await changeSpace({
  entityId: 'ENTITY_ID',
  fromSpaceId: 'FROM_SPACE_ID',
  toSpaceId: 'TO_SPACE_ID',
  // dryRun: true,
});
```

### 4. Merge Entities

Merge one or more secondary entities into a main entity. Handles both same-space and cross-space merges. If the main entity is a Property type, automatically migrates property references across all accessible spaces.

**Same-space merge logic:**
- Auto-selects the main entity among same-space candidates by backlink count, then by property+relation count
- Value properties on the main entity remain unchanged
- Missing value properties from secondaries are added to the main entity
- Non-duplicate relations from secondaries are appended to the main entity
- Duplicate relation detection checks both exact entity ID matches and "soft duplicates" (same name + type on the target entity)
- Backlinks pointing to secondaries are redirected to the main entity
- Secondary entities are deleted after merging

**Cross-space merge logic:**
- Multiple secondaries in the same foreign space are merged within that space first
- Each remaining foreign secondary is moved to the main entity's ID via `changeEntityId`

**Ops batching:** All operations accept an optional `opsBatch` parameter (`Map<string, Op[]>`) to accumulate ops across multiple merges and publish once per space at the end.

```ts
const ops = await mergeEntities({
  mainEntityId: 'MAIN_ENTITY_ID',
  mainSpaceId: 'MAIN_SPACE_ID',
  secondaries: [
    { entityId: 'SECONDARY_1', spaceId: 'SPACE_A' },
    { entityId: 'SECONDARY_2', spaceId: 'SPACE_B' },
  ],
  // dryRun: true,
  // addPropertiesToMain: false, // skip copying properties/relations from secondaries
});
```

## Find Duplicates

`02_find_duplicates.ts` scans a ranked list of spaces for Type and Property entities with duplicate names (case-insensitive). For each duplicate group it identifies a main entity (by space rank, then backlink count) and lists secondaries. For Property entities it also displays the data type and flags mismatches.

```bash
bun run 02_find_duplicates.ts
```

## Auto-Merge Duplicates

`03_merge_duplicates.ts` combines duplicate detection with automatic merging. It finds all duplicate Type and Property entities, then calls `mergeEntities` for each group. Property duplicates with data type mismatches are skipped. All ops are batched and published once per space.

```bash
bun run 03_merge_duplicates.ts
```

Set `DRY_RUN = true` at the top of the file to preview without publishing.
