# Geo submission review

Choose the requested mode. **Space discovery / recurring bounty review:** read [references/routine.md](references/routine.md), use the packaged review runner, then review its queued cases and complete the Geo delivery flow below for each curator/bounty submission. **Specified submission:** follow sections 1–4 below and complete the same Geo delivery flow. All submission reviews use the matching Geo datasets space, whether discovered by a scan, supplied by URL/DM, recurring, bespoke or without a formal bounty. This applies across spaces and bounty types. Keep the full coverage record separately from compact recipient feedback.

**Scheduled-review mode:** a prompt naming this skill and the target space invokes the [scheduled-run defaults](references/routine.md#scheduled-run-defaults). Those defaults include both paired spaces, Geo-only submission discovery, linked Discord reply drafts, the fixed private editor report and authorization/notification rules. Use `geo-submission-review` to orchestrate, the repository’s `geo-query` for graph retrieval and `geo-publish` for report publication. Scheduling and runtime readiness remain separate from these instructions.

The intake and review scripts are read-only on Geo; the agent carries out delivery through `geo-publish` and approved governance tools. Read [references/geo-delivery.md](references/geo-delivery.md) and [references/feedback-and-votes.md](references/feedback-and-votes.md). Mohammed has authorized completed submission reports to be published in the matching datasets space as the default for this workflow. Record that standing scope; apply publication safeguards and readback without asking again within it. Honor an explicit drafts-only or narrower request. Other editors need their own applicable report authorization. Geo publication and format verification are completion requirements for every submission review. An existing Notion mirror or earlier Notion review does not change that destination. Use Notion only if the editor explicitly requests it for the current review; an explicitly requested alternative or drafts-only scope takes precedence. Verify the destination's live ID, name and editor authority before publishing; a stored map or duplicate space name alone is insufficient. A supplied submission already in a verified datasets space is evidence for the matching destination. Report publication does not authorize votes, editing curator submissions, payouts or sending messages. Ask the editor to approve the concrete accept/reject vote plan, then carry out the approved actions.

## Default Geo completion flow

1. Finish the review and resolve every material submission decision.
2. Publish or update each report in the matching datasets space through `geo-publish`. Read it back and open every linked finding to verify the full details and sources.
3. Draft a short, kind curator reply with the verified report URL. For mixed batches, distinguish items that passed from those that failed, identify rejected items and say what needs attention. Keep numerical tallies and points private to the editor.
4. Present the editor with the exact proposal links, accept/reject recommendations, correction holds and execution consequences. Ask whether to carry out that plan; existing approval for those exact actions remains valid.
5. With approval, refresh proposal state, apply only the approved votes and verify them. A separate proposal-execution transaction needs explicit coverage in the approval and must wait for voting eligibility. Update feedback drafts to reflect confirmed outcomes and record receipts.

Drafting the report or reply alone does not complete Geo delivery. If publication is blocked, retain the draft and tell the editor the exact blocker; do not invent a published URL. Feedback remains a draft until sending is separately authorized. An editor approval wait is a valid handoff after the reports and linked drafts are ready.

## Mandatory editor handoff after every run

Read [references/editor-run-report.md](references/editor-run-report.md) and generate the fixed [editor report template](assets/editor-run-report.md) after every manual, scheduled, space-discovery or specified-submission run, including no-change, failed and partial runs. Save EDITOR-RUN-REPORT.md plus its JSON input privately; return the report or an accessible link. This requirement applies in every environment, not just Mohammed's workspace or one scheduler. Use the portable generator when available; otherwise fill the exact bundled template, retain every section and state the runtime/persistence limitation. Never substitute a free-form recap. Scheduled no-change runs still save the report while remaining quiet under the notification policy. Refresh it after approved actions so it distinguishes recommendations, confirmed outcomes and remaining approvals. This editor handoff does not replace Geo recipient delivery or grant any additional authorization.

## 1. Establish intent

Read the request, submission, applicable bounty requirements, and relevant existing review. For bounty-specific checks read [references/bounty-profiles.md](references/bounty-profiles.md). Full ordered bounty Text blocks and applicable linked criteria are authoritative; a preview is insufficient. A short description is the specification only when complete, space-scoped retrieval proves there are no requirement blocks; never substitute it for failed or missing block content. A bounty is optional. Derive a brief covering:

- **Intent:** what to check, the intended use of the content, and the decision this supports.
- **Scope:** items, fields, topic, period, depth, and the unit of verification.
- **Criteria and responsibility:** requirements and their source; who controls and should fix each kind of defect.
- **Delivery:** recipient, authorized destination, existing records, and completion criteria.

Use context already provided. State the brief concisely to the editor and proceed when clear; ask one focused question only if a missing choice materially changes the work. Keep the brief in the internal record rather than copying it into the recipient's page. Label inferred standards as proposed criteria; establish a criterion before treating its absence as a defect.

**For news/story submissions, read [references/news-review.md](references/news-review.md) before reviewing.** A general news review includes event duplicates and first-submission precedence, direct relevance to the actual submission space, and a distinct, substantial development. Respect an explicitly narrower request and record omitted checks internally. The news reference distinguishes event selection, submitted-content feedback and technical QA. For X posts or blogs, establish their own bounty criteria; an opinion or analysis need not report a new event. Read the full post/thread and quoted context. Check originality, attribution, relevance and significance against the actual requirements; do not invent engagement thresholds or import the news selection gate.

Use supporting skills when available and needed, or authorized tools with equivalent retrieval and readback capabilities:

| Need | Capability |
|---|---|
| Retrieve complete Geo submission collections | `geo-query`, including its submission retrieval procedure |
| Check types, properties, relations, or canonical matches | `ontology-advisor` and read-only `geo-query` |
| Create a requested Geo-to-Notion mirror | `geo-mirror` Part 1 |
| Read or write Notion | `notion-operations` |

An existing mirror need not be recreated. Use applicable team rules when available; this skill's core evidence and feedback workflow also works without those integrations.

## 2. Review the agreed scope

1. **Inventory and preserve.** Paginate requested collections. Retain stable IDs, item links, original values and snapshot time. Record gaps, exclusions and any agreed sample. Reading an item and verifying all its assertions are different units.
2. **Keep an internal coverage record.** Track completed, unresolved and unstarted checks with evidence and next action. The output limit below does not reduce the research scope. Do not stop at five findings if more agreed checks remain; if access prevents completion, record the exact limit and tell the editor.
3. **Verify independently.** Treat previous audits and supplied citations as leads. Read the relevant passage and record its direct URL, locator, date/scope, short excerpt or precise paraphrase, and what it establishes. Prefer primary records; seek independent corroboration where the claim requires it.
4. **Test the full statement.** Respect qualifiers, actor, timeframe, population, attribution and certainty. Seek evidence that could clear the suspected issue. Distinguish a contradiction, unsupported inference, unmet requirement and optional improvement. A stated policy does not prove implementation for a particular item. A recommendation does not establish completion, and does not rule out later completion. A failed search does not establish nonexistence.
5. **Handle gaps honestly.** Try an appropriate official alternative or accessible full document. If the evidence remains inaccessible, retain the check as unresolved internally. The agent's unfinished research is not a contributor defect. Request evidence from the contributor only when it is a concrete, relevant submission responsibility, explaining exactly what is needed.
6. **Explain the finding.** Tie the issue to the actual criterion and intended use. For relevance or quality judgments, name the requirement and explain how the submitted content fails it; a citation alone is insufficient. Keep resolution criteria internally for later re-review. An error in a credibility argument does not automatically disqualify the source. Distinguish a document's factual account from its legal or evaluative conclusions.
7. **Reconcile history.** Reuse the current finding for the same item, disputed content and underlying issue. Preserve original content, evidence, comments and human decisions. Keep current agent assessments consistent with current prose. Do not re-present an editor-dismissed finding as outstanding without surfacing new evidence to the editor.

For canonical comparisons, record identity, submitted/current values, space and evidence cutoff. A difference is not automatically an error. Never infer that an entity is absent from a capped or failed search.

## Completion before final reporting

A final submission report must give an evidence-backed recommendation for every scoped item: accept, reject, or return for a specific correction. **Do not deliver or publish a final report containing unresolved submission decisions.** Complete the research first: read primary records and accessible full alternatives, reconcile dates and event identity, and explain editorial significance against the bounty criterion. Keep generated-copy checks separate from event eligibility under the applicable Crypto rule; an unchecked secondary detail does not by itself cancel a qualifying event.

If a material decision still cannot be made, retain the case in the internal investigation queue and give the editor a separate, plainly labeled work-in-progress/blocker update. Do not hide the gap, rename it as rejection, assume acceptance or omit the affected item to make the report look complete. A specific evidence-backed correction can be a final review recommendation; the curator's unfinished repair is different from the agent's unfinished investigation. Preserve non-decisive audit limitations internally. Payment-ledger checks remain a separate award prerequisite and do not make completed submission decisions unresolved.

For routine batches, complete each independent selection assessment before issuing the editor-only tally; final tallies show accepted/rejected counts and applicable points, with no unresolved category. For other bounties, complete each item's assessment. Record any remaining material requirement blockers in `decisionGaps`. Read [routine.md](references/routine.md) for the completion gate and queue behavior.

## 3. Select actionable feedback

Write recipient pages in kind, clear, everyday language. Keep the title in the page name only; do not repeat it as a body heading. Explain what the review means and what the curator can act on without technical status labels. Use a readable UTC review date (for example, “Last reviewed: 3 October 2026”). When time matters, show both timestamps in UTC with dates; omit hours when dates alone establish the point. Keep precise timestamps and structured assessments internally. For Geo reports, tell readers to open each linked review in the table for its full details; verify those finding pages expose the complete original, issue and supporting evidence. Preserve meaningful uncertainty and distinguish the agent’s recommendation from an editor’s approval or payout.

Default to **1–5 priority issues**, ordered by their consequence for the intended use and the value of fixing them. Select defensible issues the recipient can act on. Keep other findings and pending checks in the internal record; do not append the full audit beneath the short table.

- Show one specific, linked example per recurring problem. Select the clearest verified instance; retain the other affected entities internally. Do not use grouped labels such as “Twelve sources,” append affected-item lists, or bundle unrelated problems into one row.
- Each row identifies the exact item and disputed excerpt or missing requirement, explains the issue, and exposes its supporting citation and relevant quote or evidence detail. Keep meaningful uncertainty in that row when it changes the requested action.
- Include verified inaccuracies the curator could review and edit before submitting, even when an injector generated them (Mohammed, 30 September 2026). Generation alone is no exemption. Technical failures such as edits not saving go to the editor/technical owner; recurring generation errors can also be recorded there while the curator receives feedback. Apply an explicitly different workflow only when supported by current editor instructions. Feedback does not automatically decide selection, voting or points.
- Agent-verified findings may be drafted immediately for editor review; drafting does not require the editor to have pre-confirmed each one. Preserve human decisions separately and never mark agent conclusions as editor approval.
- If no actionable issue is established, do not invent one to fill the table. Finish the agreed decision checks before reporting completion; if a material check is blocked, issue a separate work-in-progress update and retain the investigation internally.

## 4. Publish and verify the Geo review

Read [references/geo-delivery.md](references/geo-delivery.md) for every review. Publish the compact recipient report and its linked full finding pages in the verified matching datasets space. Use the existing compatible Page / Review finding / block model and its six comparison fields. Keep one to five distinct, evidence-backed examples, the submission title in the page name only, and an instruction to open each finding for its full original statement, issue and supporting sources. If no supported issue is established, publish a brief truthful review instead of inventing rows.

Preserve earlier reports, comments and human decisions. Match the submission and underlying finding before creating or updating; a fresh dated review may differ from a historical presentation prototype. Keep internal coverage, other findings, numerical tallies, points, cap/ledger checks and decision controls outside recipient reports and messages. Applicable editor-only item tallies and points remain separate under [routine.md](references/routine.md). Quote only text actually read, faithfully and within applicable limits; never fabricate links, quotations or evidence of absence.

Dry-run through geo-publish, then use the applicable report authorization. Read back every published field and relation in the destination perspective, open every linked finding and verify its full original, exact excerpt, issue and evidence. Inspect rendering when available. After an unknown write outcome, reconcile before retrying; publication failure leaves delivery incomplete, with a useful draft and exact blocker. A Notion page, chat answer or local file alone does not complete Geo delivery.

Return the **verified Geo datasets report URL** as the main deliverable and draft the short linked curator reply. Votes, separate execution, payouts and sending remain separately authorized actions; when no actionable governance proposal was established, record that rather than inventing a vote plan.

Only for an explicitly requested Notion alternative, read [references/notion-review.md](references/notion-review.md), use its four-column compact contract and same-identity readback, and record the editor's delivery exception. An old mirror is not an exception.

For maintainers: [evals/evals.json](evals/evals.json) contains fictional scenarios. Record actual test outcomes separately; structural validation and prepared fixtures do not prove behavioral reliability.
